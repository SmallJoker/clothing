==============================================

Depends: multiskin (available as part of 3d_armor 'multiskin' branch

Recommends: inventory_plus or unified_inventory (use only one)

Note that if you are using this in conjunction with 3d_armor then you MUST use
one of the supported inventory mods.

Adds simple clothing that can be crafted from cotton [farming:cotton] and
colored dyes (requires farming and dye mods for craft registration) otherwise
clothing will only be available from the creative inventory.
